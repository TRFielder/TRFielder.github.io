## TomFielder.co.uk

This repo contains the code for my personal website, [tomfielder.co.uk](http://www.tomfielder.co.uk/)

The main site uses Next.js for all front end content, and is served by a REST API hosted on heroku which provides routes for a MongoDB database.

The database holds information for blog posts which will be published on my site, managed by a CMS I have developed for that purpose.

[**API Repository**](https://github.com/TRFielder/blog-api/)

This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app).
